# Lab 5 Markdown File

I noticed in this lab that the WET code repreated the ame information multiple times per customer.
I created a function that would take that information and calcualte cash, tips, as well as inventory automatically per customer.

**My thought proccess is as follows:**

1. First create a function with the correct parameters

2. Have this function subract from the inventory, and add to the cash/tip count
3. Copy the customer information from the WET code
4. Rewrite the data as our function
5. Repeat to include all 15 customers

The reason I chose to do it this way becasue i understood that becasue the data we manipulate is the same, a function would be the best way to automatically change the inventory.
